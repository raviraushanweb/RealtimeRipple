# RealtimeRipple - Client

## Project Description

RealtimeRipple is a full-stack application designed to provide real-time video processing and chat functionalities. The frontend of the application is built with React and TypeScript, providing a rich user interface to interact with the backend services.

## Features

- **Video Upload:** Users can upload their video files to the server. The uploaded files are saved on the server side.
- **Video Conversion:** Uploaded video files can be converted to MP4 format using the FFmpeg utility.
- **Video Streaming:** The converted videos can be streamed to the client-side in real-time.
- **Real-time Chat:** Utilizes WebSocket to enable real-time communication between clients.

## Development Setup

1. Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the `client` directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`. The server runs on port 3000 by default, and can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Tech Stack

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types to the language.

## Structure

- `src/` directory contains all the source code for the React application.
  - `components/` contains reusable UI components.
  - `pages/` contains the main pages of the application.
  - `App.tsx` is the main file where all the routes and main components are defined.
